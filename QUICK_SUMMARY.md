# ðŸŽ¯ Summary: Complete Independence for Entry Tracking

## What Changed?

**BEFORE**: Marking group members affected the main group status
**NOW**: Each person (main + 3 members) is tracked 100% independently

## Quick Reference

### For SINGLE Registration (1 person):
- Click "Mark Entered" â†’ Person is marked as entered
- Simple and straightforward

### For GROUP Registration (4 people):
1. **Main Registrant** (the person who registered)
   - Has "Mark Entered" button
   - Tracked in `entry_status` table
   - Independent from group members

2. **Group Members** (3 additional people)
   - Each has their own "Mark Entry" button
   - Tracked in `member_entries` JSONB array
   - Each is completely independent

## Counter Display

Shows: **"X/3 group members"**
- Only counts the 3 additional members
- Main registrant shown separately
- Updates live as you mark entries

## Re-run This SQL

Re-run `/sql/enhanced_entry_tracking.sql` in Supabase to apply the independence fix.

## That's It!

Each person is now tracked separately. Mark them individually as they arrive! ðŸŽ‰

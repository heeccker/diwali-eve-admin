export type MemberEntry = {
  name: string
  email: string
  phone: string

  entered: boolean
  entry_time?: string

}

export type RegistrationSummary = Registration & {
  // ... existing fields
  member_entries?: MemberEntry[]

}
```

### 3. **Dashboard Component Enhanced** (`/components/AdminDashboard.tsx`)

## ðŸ“Š Data Structure Example

Your SQL now stores member data like this:
```json
{
  "member_entries": [
    {
      "name": "Swastik Kukreti",
      "email": "abc@gmail.com",
      "phone": "9837975855",
      "date_of_birth": "2009-07-28",
      "entered": false,
      "entry_time": null,
      "security_officer": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Vihaan",
      "email": "abc@gmail.com",
      "phone": "9058775354",
      "date_of_birth": "2008-12-25",
      "entered": true,
      "entry_time": "2025-10-16T10:30:00Z",
      "security_officer": "Security Officer Name"
    }
  ]
}
```
